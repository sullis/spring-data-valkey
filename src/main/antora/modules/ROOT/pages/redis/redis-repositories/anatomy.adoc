= Valkey Repositories Anatomy

Valkey as a store itself offers a very narrow low-level API leaving higher level functions, such as secondary indexes and query operations, up to the user.

This section provides a more detailed view of commands issued by the repository abstraction for a better understanding of potential performance implications.

Consider the following entity class as the starting point for all operations:

.Example entity
====
[source,java]
----
@ValkeyHash("people")
public class Person {

  @Id String id;
  @Indexed String firstname;
  String lastname;
  Address hometown;
}

public class Address {

  @GeoIndexed Point location;
}

[[redis.repositories.anatomy.insert]]
== Insert new

====
[source,java]
----
repository.save(new Person("rand", "al'thor"));
----

[source,text]

----

<1> Save the flattened entry as hash.
<2> Add the key of the hash written in <1> to the helper index of entities in the same keyspace.
<3> Add the key of the hash written in <2> to the secondary index of firstnames with the properties value.
<4> Add the index of <3> to the set of helper structures for entry to keep track of indexes to clean on delete/update.

<1> Remove the existing hash to avoid leftovers of hash keys potentially no longer present.
<2> Save the flattened entry as hash.
<3> Add the key of the hash written in <1> to the helper index of entities in the same keyspace.
<4> Get existing index structures that might need to be updated.
<5> Check if the index exists and what type it is (text, geo, â€¦).
<6> Remove a potentially existing key from the index.
<7> Remove the helper holding index information.
<8> Add the key of the hash added in <2> to the secondary index of firstnames with the properties value.
<9> Add the index of <6> to the set of helper structures for entry to keep track of indexes to clean on delete/update.
====

[[redis.repositories.anatomy.geo]]
== Save Geo Data

Geo indexes follow the same rules as normal text based ones but use geo structure to store values.
Saving an entity that uses a Geo-indexed property results in the following commands:

====
[source,text]
----
GEOADD "people:hometown:location" "13.361389" "38.115556" "76900e94-b057-44bc-abcf-8126d51a621b"  <1>
SADD   "people:76900e94-b057-44bc-abcf-8126d51a621b:idx" "people:hometown:location"               <2>
----

<1> Add the key of the saved entry to the the geo index.
<2> Keep track of the index structure.
====

[[redis.repositories.anatomy.index]]
== Find using simple index

====
[source,java]
----

<2> Fetch each key returned by <1> individually.
