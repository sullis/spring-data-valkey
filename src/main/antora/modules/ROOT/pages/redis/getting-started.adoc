= Getting Started

An easy way to bootstrap setting up a working environment is to create a Spring-based project via https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&dependencies=data-redis[start.spring.io] or create a Spring project in https://spring.io/tools[Spring Tools].

== Examples Repository

The GitHub https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples[spring-data-examples repository] hosts several examples that you can download and play around with to get a feel for how the library works.

[[redis.hello-world]]
== Hello World

First, you need to set up a running Valkey server.
Spring Data Valkey requires Valkey 2.6 or above and Spring Data Valkey integrates with https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core[Lettuce] and https://github.com/redis/jedis[Jedis], two popular open-source Java libraries for Valkey.

Now you can create a simple Java application that stores and reads a value to and from Valkey.

Create the main application to run, as the following example shows:

[tabs]
======
Imperative::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----
include::example$examples/ValkeyApplication.java[tags=file]
----

Reactive::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
----
include::example$examples/ReactiveValkeyApplication.java[tags=file]
----
======

Even in this simple example, there are a few notable things to point out:

* You can create an instance of javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.core.ValkeyTemplate[] (or javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.core.ReactiveValkeyTemplate[]for reactive usage) with a javadoc:org.springframework.data.redis.connection.ValkeyConnectionFactory[]. Connection factories are an abstraction on top of the supported drivers.
* There's no single way to use Valkey as it comes with support for a wide range of data structures such as plain keys ("strings"), lists, sets, sorted sets, streams, hashes and so on.
